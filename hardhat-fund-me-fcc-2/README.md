# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

I reached the part for deploying it in my localhost, but it shows lots of errors while trying to launch it. I should send few ETH to my localhost in the metamask in order to run it( that is my suspission). Also I should fixed it on sepholia because goereli network will disapper or cost a money for interacting with them.
